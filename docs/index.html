    <p>Hi! This is me Janet Pituch I am a Digit major with two minors in data visualization and communication of multimedia. This site is to show what I can do and how well I understand my major and minors. I hope you all enjoy this webiste as much as i enjoy making this site.</p>
    <p>I would like to take this time to let you understand why I choose Penn State Behrend. I choose Behrend for the distance. I live in a little town near hear called Union City which gives me the oppertunity to drive home and work at Parker Haniffin. Right now I work in the HR office as an HR intern due to my school schedule and assembly not mixing well. Working at Parker in assembly and HR taught me many things.</p>
